### What this is:
This is a basic api that takes user input data (name and job) and sends it via POST request to some random
REST api I found online. 

##### To Do:
1. Connect with google translate api. This is done via POST requests and with JSON access tokens. Shouldn't be
too challenging with our current setup. 
2. Live reloading of POST request with each keystroke. I am currently using a submit button that triggers the request. 
I think all I need to do is change the event handler. 
3. Keyboard. That'll be interesting.
